# Goals
## Subteam transparency and knowledge transfer 
iGEM is a holistic competition. Having a strong drylab will get you no better than silver if the other subteams are struggling.
Everyone is expected to have an educated and in depth knowledge of the project from every angle; drylab, wetlab and HP. This is not possible without documentation from each subteam.

"Encourage creativity; the more knowledge sharing we have, the better different subteams can collaborate 
The more integrated each subteam is the better we will perform at iGEM."

## Wiki Transfer
Everyone is expected to write on the wiki

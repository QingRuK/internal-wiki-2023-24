# Welcome

Welcome to the UBC iGEM 2023-2024 Internal Wiki. Read these pages before you start adding to our wiki!
- [How to Document](./documentation/index.md)
    - [For members](./documentation/member.md)
    - [For leads](./documentation/lead.md)
    - [For wiki liaisons](./documentation/liaison.md)

If you have any questions regarding documenting your progress and work, please send a Slack to Lucy.

## What should this internal wiki contain?
This wiki contains everything that lets other members know how other subteams get things running, what other subteams are researching, and the current state of a subteam. What differentiates this internal wiki from the master todo list is that, from the master todo list you can see a task someone in drylab is working on, and on this internal wiki you can read about the progress, current state, and future plans that member (or subteam) has regarding this task.

On the sidebar you can see all the different categories for each subteam. These folders were put here for a reason; they are a one to one correspondance with the required wiki pages for the iGEM competition. Create files within these folders when adding your content. We are not writing the final wiki content here. This is purely documentation for every subteam. Any content that is related to any of these topics on the sidebar should be here.

Later when we start writing our final content for the iGEM Wiki, use this documentation site as a way to quickly and efficiently absorb and understand material from all our different subteams. The final wiki document is NOT HERE. When you start wiki writing, you will be DIRECTLY commiting to the iGEM provisioned Wiki repository.

## What doesn't this internal wiki contain?
Subteam meeting notes, administrative documents, sponsorship documents, finance. Anything sub-related to our project. Message Lucy or your lead to verify what goes here. Documentation officially starts when we are finished with pitching and have chosen a project.

## Goals
### Subteam transparency 
Commits to this internal wiki hub are public. Members can see who is contributing to our docoumentation and who isn't. The goal is for everyone to be an engaged and active member. Contributing to our documention in a consistent manner is one way to do so. This includes recording down setbacks, progress, blockers, wins and more. 

One notable requirement of iGEM is to demonstrate we have used the Engineering Cycle in our project. This entails our demonstrating that we are iterating on the design of our project which is only possible if we record down what went wrong and how we plan to fix it. 

Additionally, iGEM also requires a notebook (from wetlab, but drylab should also have individual notebooks). Anyone should be able to freely access these notebooks to inquire about what subteams are up to.

We are also using [software practices](#why-are-we-using-software-practices) when adding content to our internal wiki. This includes making each member making a personal branch to pull updates and push their own, making PRs to merge their content into the main branch and more. If you are confused by this, wait until our Git, GitHub and Documentation workshop; if you're still confused Slack Lucy.  

### Knowledge Transfer
Encourage creativity; the more knowledge sharing we have, the better different subteams can collaborate. The more integrated each subteam is the better we will perform at iGEM.

**iGEM is a holistic competition.** Having a strong drylab will get you no better than silver if other subteams are struggling. Everyone is expected to have an educated and in depth knowledge of the project from every angle; drylab, wetlab and HP. This is not possible without documentation from each subteam. 

Additionally, teams must integrate each other's work into their own work. This is only possbile if knowledge is being shared between all members of the team.

### Concrete, small steps (with deliverables) towards our goal
The iGEM project involves many moving parts from all our subteams. In order to ensure everyone is aware of what is going on and to comply with [subteam transparency](#subteam-transparency), we must break our project down into a few overarching goals, and then these goals into concrete, small steps. **Leads should create goals** based on their subteams and larger tasks for these goals, while **subteam members should take these larger tasks and break them down into smaller tasks for themselves**. This should all be recorded on the internal wiki. New folders and files should be created to aid this process.

Now you're asking, what does it mean to create a concrete, small step?

#### Concrete (with a meaningful deliverable)
When defining a next course of action, either for your subteam members or yourself, make sure there is a clear reason for doing this task that contributes to an overarching goal. Each task should also have deliverable that indicates that this step has been successfully completed. For instance, if you are a lead and have given your subteam members a task to understand Golden Gate Assembly, there are two things you should think about. One, why should they learn this procedure? In the context of synthetic biology, you should let your members know that [Golden Gate Assmebly](https://technology.igem.org/assembly/golden-gate) is an "extremely powerful modular assembly technique in synthetic biology that allows for the efficient and precise assembly of multiple DNA fragments into a single construct." and that we are planning to use this technique in our experiments. Even if you believe the reasoning behind a task is obvious, this is not the case for every member. Be explicit in this reasoning.

Two, how can your subteam members can explicitly demonstrate this understanding in a way that if possible, benefits all members? For instance, ask every member to upload their notes to this internal wiki; then members from other subteams can read what they have written and understand the Golden Gate Assembly as well. This not only allows your members to consolidate their understanding of Golden Gate Assembly, but also to allow knowledge sharing to other subteams.

#### Small
Tasks should be defined such that they can be completed within a certain time period and contribute to an overarching goal. Time periods that make sense include weekly (to present at our weekly generals) or biweekly; anything more than a month indicates the task may too large or vaguely. If a task you are defining is taking longer than a week or two, then that task can be broken down into smaller tasks. This includes documentation; this documentation should be updated at least once a week from each subteam. 

Based on weekly tasks leads give their subteam members, each member should create daily tasks for themselves, that are recorded on this internal wiki. Smaller tasks allow leads to check in on their members to see how they are progressing within the larger weekly task.

### Wiki Transfer
Everyone is expected to write on the wiki. Having your progress, results and knowledge here will make wiki writing easier for everyone.

## Questions
### Why mdBook?
### Why are we using GitHub and Git?
### Is it okay if I have everything locally?
### Why are we using software/agile practices?

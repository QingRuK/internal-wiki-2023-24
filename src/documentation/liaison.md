# For wiki liaisons

Your role of wiki liaison well ensure our goals:

1. [Subteam Transparency](../index.md#subteam-transparency)
2. [Knowledge Transfer](../index.md#knowledge-transfer)
3. [Concrete, small steps (with deliverables) towards our goal](../index.md#concrete-small-steps-with-deliverables-towards-our-goal)

are met.

## Why was this role created? 
This role was created out of fustration from Lucy and Piyush. We noticed a disconnect between subteams, and during wiki development, only a few members could contribute to writing because frankly, many members just did not know what was happening outside their subteam. Wiki liaisons are responsible for knowing what is happening outside their own subteam, ensure team members (in their own subteam) are contributing to the internal wiki and helping Lucy plan for the final competition wiki. All the leads will be ensuring this happens, but wiki liaisons will be a helping hand, and can offer new perspectives that leads may not notice.

### Our wiki liaisons are: 
- Wet lab:
- Dry lab:
- HP:

## What is a wiki liaison?
Generally, a wiki liaison is a subteam member who is not a lead that is responsible for ensuring that work other subteams are cdoing are well integrated into with their own subteam's work. This means the wiki liaison helps the wiki lead enforce standards like the internal wiki so that we can meet the three goals listed above. They will also have a greater hand in helping design, edit and completing the wiki for the iGEM Jamboree.

## What are my tasks? 
To have subteam transparency and integration, you will help the wiki lead ensure the entire team is writing project related content on the internal wiki, as related to *your* subteam. This means if you're in wet lab, you make sure all experimental designs and changes are being committed to the internal wiki on a daily/weekly basis.

Secondly, after each subteam uploads content to the internal wiki, wiki liaisons are responsible for reading other team's content on the internal wiki. Generally, you are trying to form an overall sense of the goals, directions and motivations of the other subteams. This will help you for the third task.

Thirdly, after you have ensured your subteam is contributing to the internal wiki, and have an understanding of what other subteams are doing, you will be responsible for critically analyzing the work of other subteams. For instance, if you are the dry lab liaison, you will have read over the wet lab and HP pages. If the wet lab plasmid design pages are hard to understand or missing information, you will create a GitHub issue stating what is missing and why this information is important, then send a message to the #documentation-wiki channel, tagging the appropriate poeple and linking the issue. If human practices has described a computational concept incorrectly, or you can enhance the educational material, similarly, make an issue and complete the previously listed steps. The point of all this work is to have all our subteams be cohesive and integrated.

Finally, when we are writing the wiki for the iGEM Jamboree, you will help the leads design the flow of information. You may also help assign other subteam members to writing and reading content.

## Who do I ask for help?
This may seem overwhelming, and you may be scared or nervous to call out other subteam members. If that case, you can DM Lucy and she will alert the appropriate subteam members. At anytime if you feel this role is overwhelming let the co-directors or Lucy know.

If you have any questions that are not of a personal nature, send a message in #documentation-wiki, otherwise DM Lucy.

## What is my role in developing the competition wiki?
You can take on a "writing", "editing" or "development" role. More on this later.

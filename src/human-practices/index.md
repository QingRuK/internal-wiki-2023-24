To receive a silver medal for our project, we need to convince our judges that we have thought carefully about the impacts of our work and document how we have investigated these issues. For the gold medal which is what we are aiming for, we need to expand on our silver medal requirements by integrating HP into our purpose, design, and execution of our project.

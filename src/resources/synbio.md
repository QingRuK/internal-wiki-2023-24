Thanks to Piyush and Kimia for these resources!

## Introduction to Synthetic Biology

Synthetic biology is a field of biology that combines principles of engineering and science to create new biological systems or modify existing ones for specific purposes. This can include the engineering of new enzymes, the creation of living organisms with specific properties or the development of new genetic circuits. The ultimate goal of synthetic biology is to create new functions or applications that are not found in nature.

To begin, familiarize yourself with general biology. In the suggested videos below, I will be focusing on the central dogma of biology (how do we get from DNA to protein), but I **highly recommend** you look into additional resources if you need help!

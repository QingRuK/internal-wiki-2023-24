# Welcome

Welcome to the UBC iGEM 2023-2024 Internal Wiki. Read these pages before you start adding to our wiki!
- [How to Document](./documentation/index.md)
    - [For members](./documentation/member.md)
    - [For leads](./documentation/lead.md)

If you have any questions regarding documenting your progress and work, please send a Slack to Lucy.

## What should this internal wiki contain?
- on the sidebar you can see all the different categories for each subteam. These folders were put here for a reason; they are a one to one correspondance with the required wiki pages for the iGEM competition. Create files within these folders when adding your content. We are not writing the final wiki content here. This is purely documentation for every subteam. Any content that is related to any of these topics on the sidebar should be here.
- later when we start writing our final content for the iGEM Wiki, use this documentation site as a way to quickly and efficiently absorb and understand material from all our different subteams.
    - the final wiki document is NOT HERE. When you start wiki writing, you will be DIRECTLY commiting to the iGEM provisioned Wiki repository.

## What doesn't this internal wiki contain?
- subteam meeting notes, administrative documents, sponsorship documents, finance. Anything sub-related to our project. Message Lucy or your lead to verify what goes here.

## Goals
### Subteam transparency 
Commits to this internal wiki hub are public. Members can see who is contributing to our docoumentation and who isn't. The goal is for everyone to be an engaged and active member. Contributing to our documention in a consistent manner is one way to do so. This includes recording down setbacks, progress, blockers, wins and more. 

One notable requirement of iGEM is to demonstrate we have used the Engineering Cycle in our project. This entails our demonstrating that we are iterating on the design of our project which is only possible if we record down what went wrong and how we plan to fix it. 

Additionally, iGEM also requires a notebook (from wetlab, but drylab should also have individual notebooks). Anyone should be able to freely access these notebooks to inquire about what subteams are up to.

We are also using software practices when adding content to our internal wiki.

### Knowledge Transfer
Encourage creativity; the more knowledge sharing we have, the better different subteams can collaborate. The more integrated each subteam is the better we will perform at iGEM.

iGEM is a holistic competition. Having a strong drylab will get you no better than silver if the other subteams are struggling.
Everyone is expected to have an educated and in depth knowledge of the project from every angle; drylab, wetlab and HP. This is not possible without documentation from each subteam. 

Additionally, teams must integrate each other's work into their own work. This is only possbile if knowledge is being shared between all members of the team.

### Tangible, iterative steps towards our goal

### Wiki Transfer
Everyone is expected to write on the wiki. Having your progress, results and knowledge here will make wiki writing easier for everyone.

## Questions
### Why mdBook?
### Why are we using GitHub and Git?
### Is it okay if I have everything locally?

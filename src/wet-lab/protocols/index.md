# Protocols

For each protocol, create a new file in SUMMARY.md. Include pictures, graphics, external sites to help explain your protocols to the other subteam members. Lots of protocols already exist on Google Drive. If they do, then link that protocol to the internal wiki. If you are designing a new protocol or editing an already existing protocol, please add it to the internal wiki. Lucy and wiki liaisons will be checking!
